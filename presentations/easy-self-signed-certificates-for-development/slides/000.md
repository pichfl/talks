# Easy, local, & self-signed <br>certificates for local developement

---

## Hi, I'm Florian

Working at ~~simplabs~~ Mainmatter as a consulting developer/designer.

---

### What

**`ember serve`**
http==s==://localhost:4200


Note:
 
Run your ember development server on localhost, but with SSL certificates.

---

### Why

==Secure== browser context for debugging

Cookies, Crypto, Service Workers, and many more new browser APIS

---

### How

Meet `mkcert`!

Self-signed certificates + _magic*_


Note: 

Installs a local root certificate for you

---

## mkcert.dev

`brew install mkcert`

---
 
### Quick, to the ~~batmobile~~ shell!
```
cd /your/ember/project 
mkdir ./ssl
touch ./ssl/.gitkeep

mkcert \
-install \
-cert-file ./ssl/server.crt \
-key-file ./ssl/server.key \
localhost
```

---

### Done.
	**`ember serve --ssl`**
	**`https://localhost:4200`**

--- 

# Thanks!
