## Instructions

This project uses the latest beta of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com).

To run a development build, use `gulp` to start a live reloading server.

To build a static version, using `gulp collect` produces a `dist` folder containing all required files to run the site locally in your browser.

Using `gulp publish` will publish a fresh build to Github pages, using the repository origin as reference.


## Some included tools and tasks

- SASS
- PostCSS, Autoprefixer, mq-packer
- browserify/watchifiy JS bundler
- Revisioning
- ESLint
- Handlebars, Markdown, Frontmatter
